# Stack

**Stack** is a linear data structure with ability to add and remove items.
Basically, it has `push` operation to insert the element, and `pop` operation
without arguments to delete the element.

Stack implements a `last-in, first-out`, or `LIFO`, policy. The element deleted
from the collection is the one most recently inserted.

The name **"stack"** comes from the analogy to physical stacks, such as the
spring-loaded stacks of plates used in cafeterias. The order in which plates are
popped from the stack is the reverse of the order in which they were pushed onto
the stack, since only the top plate is accessible.

##### Time complexity

| Push | Pop  | Peek |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| O(1) | O(1) | O(1) |

##### Space Complexity

O(n)
