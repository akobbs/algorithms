# Fibonacci

The Fibonacci Sequence is the series of numbers:
`0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...`

The next number is found by adding up the two numbers before it.

### Memoization

is an optimization technique used to speed up calculations by storing the
results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the
same inputs occur again

### Complexity

| Type  | Recursive | Recursive with memoization | Iterative |
| ----- | --------- | -------------------------- | --------- |
| Time  | O(2^n)    | O(n)                       | O(n)      |
| Space | O(n)      | O(n)                       | O(1)      |
