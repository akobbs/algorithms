# Max subset no adjacent elements

Given an array of positive numbers, find the maximum sum of a subsequence with
the constraint that no 2 numbers in the sequence should be adjacent in the
array.

### Examples:

#### 1

- Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
- Output: 9 (sum of 1, 3 and 5)

#### 2

- Input: [8, 15, 7, 10, 9]
- Output: 25 (sum of 15 and 10)

### TODO:

- solution with negative numbers
- return precise elements
