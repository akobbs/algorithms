# Insertion Sort

### Algorithm

Iterates, consuming one input element each repetition, and growing a sorted
output list. At each iteration, insertion sort removes one element from the
input data, finds the location it belongs within the sorted list, and inserts it
there. It repeats until no input elements remain.

### Time complexity

- Worst-case: `O(n^2)`
- Best-case (sorted array): `O(n)`
- Average: `O(n^2)`

### Space Complexity

`O(1)`
